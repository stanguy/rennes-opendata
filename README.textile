Consider this an interactive API explorer. On the left, you will find available methods, and when one is selected, its parameters. If a parameter is mandatory, it will be displayed with a red border. If a parameter is a potential result from another method, a ">" link will be on its right allowing one to jump from one method to the other and selecting a value from the list of results.

Obviously, you must provide your own registered API key.

When fetching organizations using the OpenData API, we get both an address and a position for organizations. How accurates are they really? This page provides a basic interface to getorganization and computes the distance between the known position and the position retrieved using Google's geocoder. If the distance is over 1000 meters a warning color is applied on the list.

It takes too long to execute? Well, Google's geocoder has a limit on the number of requests, so I explicitely limit the rate of my requests to do a maximum of those.

Oh, and yeah, obviously, again, bring your own API key.
